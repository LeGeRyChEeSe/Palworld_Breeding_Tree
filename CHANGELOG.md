## [3.0.4] - 2025-08-19

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Graph Management Optimization**: Removed redundant `couplesMaked` list and implemented efficient set-based duplicate prevention in `getEdges()` method for faster graph construction
- **Memory Management**: Introduced thread-safe LRU cache system (`LRUImageCache`) with 100MB memory limit for better resource management
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Improved breeding path calculation efficiency by preventing duplicate couple processing

### üîß Core System Enhancements
- **Resource Handling**: Enhanced PyInstaller compatibility with improved `resourcePath()` function using `getattr()` for safer MEIPASS access
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive exception handling in image loading operations to prevent crashes
- **Graphviz Integration**: Improved PATH configuration and binary detection for better cross-system compatibility
- **Build System**: Updated build script (`build.bat`) with dynamic version retrieval and relative path handling

### üé® User Interface & Features  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expanded internationalization from 3 to 9 languages:
  - Added: German (de), Spanish (es), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru)
  - Existing: English (en), French (fr), Chinese (ch)
- **Window Management**: Enhanced TreeFrame resizing with debouncing mechanism (150ms delay) for smoother UI performance
- **Configuration System**: Added `locked` parameter support for persistent frame states in tree windows

### üìö Documentation & Project Structure
- **README Overhaul**: Complete redesign with modern GitHub badges, multi-language sections, and comprehensive feature overview
- **Development Workflow**: Improved build process with automatic version handling
- **Git Configuration**: Updated `.gitignore` to include Claude Code files and build directories
